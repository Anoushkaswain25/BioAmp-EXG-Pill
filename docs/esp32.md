# **ESP32**
We are delighted to share that Upside down Labs has come up with an update in ***BioAmp-Exg-Pill***, now it can be coupled with ***Espressif’s ESP32*** which is a feature-rich MCU with integrated Wi-fi and Bluetooth connectivity. 

## **TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION**

<ol>
<li> Wireless connectivity:150.0 Mbps data rate </li>
<li> Bluetooth: BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) and Bluetooth Classic </li>
<li> Processor: 32-bit LX6 microprocessor</li>
<li> Memory:
<br> <ul> <li> ROM: 448 KB 
<li> SRAM: 520 KB </li></ul>
<li> Peripheral Input/Output: 
<br> <ul> <li> peripheral interface with DMA that includes capacitive touch
<li> ADCs (Analog-to-Digital Converter)
<li> DACs (Digital-to-Analog Converter)
<li> I²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)
<li>UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)
<li> SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
<li>I²S (Integrated Interchip Sound)
<li>RMII (Reduced Media-Independent Interface)
<li>PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation)</li> </ul>
<li> Security: hardware accelerators for AES and SSL/TLS</ol>

## **BENEFITS**
<ul>
<li>Low-cost</li>
<li>Low-power</li>
<li>ESP32 can easily connect to a Wi-Fi network to connect to the internet (station mode), or create its own Wi-Fi wireless network (access point mode)</li>
<li>ESP32 supports Bluetooth classic and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)</li>
<li> Most ESP32 are dual-core— they come with 2 Xtensa 32-bit LX6 microprocessors: core 0 and core 1.</li>
<li>Rich peripheral input/output interface</li>
</ul>
